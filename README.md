# ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Boilerplate with Repository Pattern

This project is a boilerplate template for creating a Web API using ASP.NET Core 6. It implements the Repository Pattern and uses Entity Framework Core for data access. This template is designed as a starter point for any ASP.NET Core Web API project, providing a clean and modular codebase with sample data.

## Features
-**ASP.NET Core 6**: Leverages the latest features and improvements in ASP.NET Core 6.
-**Repository Pattern**: Provides a clean separation of concerns and makes it easy to swap out data storage methods.
-**Entity Framework Core**: Uses EF Core for data access, making it easy to query and manage data in a database.
-**Sample Data**: Includes sample data models and seed data for easy setup and testing.
-**Swagger Integration**: Pre-configured Swagger UI for API testing and documentation.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running:

## Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) or any compatible database (if using EF Core)

## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aspnet-core-6-webapi-boilerplate.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd aspnet-core-6-webapi-boilerplate
Restore the packages:

bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
Update the database (if using EF Core):

bash
Copy code
dotnet ef database update
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run
The API will be accessible at https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure:

Controllers: API controllers for handling HTTP requests.
Repositories: Interfaces and implementations for accessing data.
Models: Data models representing entities in the database.
Data: EF Core DbContext and seed data initialization.

Usage
Customize the models, repositories, and controllers according to your project's requirements.
Update the connection string in appsettings.json to point to your database.
Use Swagger (/swagger/index.html) for testing and documentation.
